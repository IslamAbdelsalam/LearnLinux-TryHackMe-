T1 & T2 
An introduction to Linux start in 1991
Where is Linux Used?
It's fair to say that Linux is a lot more intimidating to approach than Operating System's (OSs) such as Windows. Both variants have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Linux is considerably much more lightweight and you'd be surprised to know that there's a good chance you've used Linux in some form or another every day! Linux powers things such as:

Websites that you visit
Car entertainment/control panels
Point of Sale (PoS) systems such as checkout tills and registers in shops
Critical infrastructures such as traffic light controllers or industrial sensors

Understanding why Linux is so commonplace today
Interacting with your first-ever Linux machine!
Ran some of the most fundamental commands
Had an introduction to navigating around the filesystem & how we can use commands like find and grep to make finding data even more efficient!
 Power up your commands by learning about some of the important shell operators.
